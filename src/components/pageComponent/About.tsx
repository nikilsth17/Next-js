            <p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years ago,
                I have done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I am quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chopsone design problem at a time.
